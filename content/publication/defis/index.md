abstract: "Using detailed survey data collected by Cereq (the Defis survey), linked to French administrative data on wages (DADS), we first carry out reduced-form analysis in the shape of difference-in-differences (DiD) estimates of the impact of formal training on wages and other outcomes. The estimated effects on wages are negligible, but we find small positive effects of training on the probability of gaining a permanent contract (CDI) and on becoming a full-time employee. These effects appear to be driven mainly by individuals who move firm. We then exploit a policy-relevant instrumental variable (IV)---whether the individual reports having received information on training from their firm. IV estimates of the same effects are larger in magnitude but are not statistically significant at even the 10% level. We then introduce unobserved heterogeneity as latent types. Our novel identification strategy allows us to use a binary instrument to estimate the effects of multivalued treatment. We estimate our model on the Defis data via the EM algorithm, and calculate analogues of the reduced-form treatment effects, to enable comparison with DiD and IV approaches. Our flexible model and estimation approach allows us to produce wage distributions conditional on worker type and training status."
