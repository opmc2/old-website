title: "The role of earnings expectations versus non-pecuniary factors in university attendance"
summary: "
Why do some people choose to attend university, and enjoy state-subsidised benefits, while others do not?
I shed new light on this key issue by comparing and quantifying the roles of earnings expectations and non-pecuniary factors in educational decisions and career choices.
I also investigate changes over time, and the implications for social mobility.
To do this, I specify a Roy-like model of educational choice, in which I explicitly include earnings expectations and other, non-pecuniary, factors.
I estimate my model on detailed longitudinal data from two UK cohorts, using information on students' choices and their later wages. 
In particular, I exploit data on students' expectations about key non-pecuniary outcomes both at, and after, university.
I find that income maximisation, despite its prevalent role in the literature, is only a small part of the story: non-pecuniary factors are four times as important as earnings expectations in determining whether someone goes to university. 
Non-pecuniary factors also drive the SES-gap in educational attainment, and are responsible for the huge growth in degree attainment between the 1970 and 1990 cohorts.
I then specify an improved model of earnings expectations, allowing for unobserved heterogeneity in students' earnings expectations. 
I use a novel technique to estimate the model via the EM-algorithm, which I developed with coauthors in another project.
Estimation of this updated model is currently ongoing.
