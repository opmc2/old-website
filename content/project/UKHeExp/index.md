title: "Who goes to university and why? A comparison across cohorts (1985 -- 2015)"
summary: "
I investigate the role of earnings expectations on young people's educational decisions and career choices. 
Exploiting detailed longitudinal data on two UK cohorts, I model educational and career decisions and use a combination of choice data, wages and survey questions to better understand the factors that impact their decisions. I compare these factors across time (cohort vs cohort) and across socio-economic status (within cohorts).
Preliminary results suggest that for both cohorts non-earnings factors are more important than earnings expectations in determining whether a student decides to continue on to higher education, and are also the main driver of the SES-gap in educational attainment.
These factors are also responsible for the huge growth in degree attainment between the 1970 and 1990 cohorts, with the distribution in earnings expectations remaining largely constant across cohorts. 
Meanwhile, the increase in the non-earnings factors across cohorts is equivalent to a 50\% increase in earnings expectations. 
Decomposition analysis of the non-earnings factors is ongoing, and will hopefully shed light on the main components of these 'psychic costs'.
