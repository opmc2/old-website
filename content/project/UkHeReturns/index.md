title: "Revisiting the wage returns to university via a non-parametric finite-mixture approach to difference-in-difference estimation"
summary: "
Using a novel methodology I estimate the wage returns to a university education in the UK for two cohorts separated by 20 years: one who left school at the beginning of a period of huge expansion in university attainment (1988) and the other who left school as the expansion slowed (2008). 
I exploit the economic content of the Roy model to justify exclusion restrictions, allowing non-parametric identification of a model with unobserved heterogeneity. 
The model is flexible enough to allow any number of post-schooling observations, so we can compare results on short panels (both cohorts) with those exploiting longer panels (1988 school leavers).
Estimation is currently ongoing."
