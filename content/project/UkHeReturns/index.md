title: "The returns to different subjects and institutions in higher education"
summary: "Using the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) supplemented by more detailed longitudinal surveys, I estimate *ex post* returns to different subjects and types of higher education institutions (HEIs). 
I find large dipersion in returns across both subjects and HEIs within cohorts, to the extent that choices *between subjects conditional on continuing to HE* can be more important for earnings than the choice to continue to HE. 
Comparing across cohorts the ranking of subjects by median earnings has changed drastically over recent decades.
Work to incorporate and control for important factors such as ability to understand whether these cross-subject differences are driven by differences in the students who choose these subjects, or whether different subjects have vastly different *causal effects on earnings* is ongoing."
